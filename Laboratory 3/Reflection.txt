The easiest design for me to make was the square social media post because I had a clear, simple vision that translated easily into the Canva post I made. The only part that took longer than expected was the chibi drawing of the character in the design. To ensure consistent branding across all three images, I used the color scheme, fonts, and logo from my branding kit, ensuring each design was cohesive and linked to the others. I also made sure the text was visible by using contrasting colors so nothing blends into the background, and by choosing fonts that, while stylized, are still legible. Moreover, I observed visual hierarchy by making the font sizes of the titles and headers larger, followed by the rest of the content in a smaller font. In one, I added a colored background to give contrast and emphasize where to look. I learned that creating social media graphics is not an easy task because it needs to consider many factors, such as brand consistency, design elements, aesthetics, and memorability.
