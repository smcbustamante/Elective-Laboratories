The easiest design for me to make was the square social media post because I had a clear, yet simple vision that easily translated into the canva post that I made. The only part that made me take longer than expected was the chibi drawing of the character in the design. To ensure that consistent branding was applied in all three images, I used the color scheme, fonts, and logo from my branding kit, making sure that each design was both cohesive and linked to one another. I also made sure that the text was visible by employing contrasting colors so nothing blends into the background while choosing fonts that, while stylized, can still be understood. Moreover, I observed visual hierarchy by having the font size of the titles and headers be larger, followed by the rest of the content in a smaller font. In one, I added a colored background to give contrast and emphasize where to look. I learned that creating social media graphics is not an easy task because it needs to consider many factors such as brand consistency, design elements, aesthetics, and memorability.
