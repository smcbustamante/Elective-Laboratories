I found the balance principle of design to be the most useful because it brings all the elements togethe in a clear and visually satisfying way. For me, the easiest part of Canva to use is its elements. I can easily access the graphic elements of Canva due to its user-friendly interface. Meanwhile, generating the QR code was the hardest since I was unfamiliar with making one in Canva and it was my first time. I learned that in visual communication, a simple design isn't necessarily plain and can actually be the most impactful part of a message. Moreover, I learned that every element of a presentation builds on one another to create an image that influences emotions and perspectives.
