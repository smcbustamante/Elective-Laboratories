The purpose of my app is to help in productivity by helping users track their tasks, manage their time, and study for quizzes and exams. My target users are students who want to strike a balance between school works and private life. I chose my colors to be similar to my branding kit as a way to be consistent with my other outputs thus far. However, when it came to the layout, I chose a more simplistic, yet easily navigatable one so that students won't be lost when using the app. I also took layout inspirations from other apps or websites, such as Canva, Calendar, and Samsung Notes, and searched for reference layouts when making the grade calculator and time usage analytics. A notable challenge that I faced was deciding the right layout for my analytics and grade calculator. If I have more time, I would like to improve on my navigation and refine the layout for the prototype so that it is more immersive.
