The purpose of my app is to help in productivity by helping users track their tasks, manage their time, and study for quizzes and exams. My target users are students who want to strike a balance between schoolwork and their personal lives. I chose my colors to be similar to my branding kit to maintain consistency with my other outputs thus far. However, for the layout, I chose a simpler, yet easily navigable one, so students won't get lost when using the app. I also drew inspiration for the layout from other apps and websites, such as Canva, Calendar, and Samsung Notes, and searched for reference layouts when creating the grade calculator and time usage analytics. A notable challenge that I faced was deciding the right layout for my analytics and grade calculator. If I had more time, I would like to improve my navigation and refine the layout of the prototype to make it more immersive.
