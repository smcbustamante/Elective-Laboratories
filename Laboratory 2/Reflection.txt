There are quite a few things that inspired my branding: a song, my love for cute and softcore styles, and hearts. As for my color palette, I originally planned to have green as one of the main colors along with white. However, when I made my logo, I ended up filling all my possible color slots, so I went with that palette instead. Creating my logo didn't present as many challenges as I thought it would. However, the challenge I would consider was the four-pointed star on the heart, which took me a little while to decide whether to fill in the outline. I plan to use this branding in future projects by maintaining the cute, bright, letter-esque aesthetic and keeping consistent elements, such as fonts and images.
