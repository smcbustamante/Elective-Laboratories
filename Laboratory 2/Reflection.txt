There are quite a few things that inspired my branding, one of which was a song, my love for cute and softcore styles, and hearts. As for my color palette, I originally planned to have green as one of the main colors along with white. However, when I made my logo, I ended up filling all my possible color slots, so I went with that palette instead. In creating my logo, I didn't face as much challenges than I thought I would. However, the challenge that I would consider was the four-pointed star on the heart, in which it took a little while for me to decide whether to fill in the outline or not. I plan to use this branding in future projects by keeping the cute, bright, and letter-esque aesthetic, and by having consistent elements, such as font and images, in my future projects.
